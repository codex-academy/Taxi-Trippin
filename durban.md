# Durban taxis

Here's our Durbs data.

```javascript
var durbanTaxis = [
  {
    "RegistrationNumber": "ND 123 456",
    "Route": "Durban - University of KZN",
    "Fare": 7,
    "Trips": 14
  },
  {
    "RegistrationNumber": "ND 234 567",
    "Route": "Durban - Umlazi Station",
    "Fare": 14,
    "Trips": 9
  },
  {
    "RegistrationNumber": "ND 345 678",
    "Route": "Durban - Umbilo",
    "Fare": 8,
    "Trips": 14
  },
  {
    "RegistrationNumber": "ND 234 567",
    "Route": "Durban - Umlazi Station",
    "Fare": 14,
    "Trips": 9
  },
  {
    "RegistrationNumber": "ND 234 567",
    "Route": "Durban - University of KZN",
    "Fare": 7,
    "Trips": 9
  },
  {
    "RegistrationNumber": "ND 345 678",
    "Route": "Durban - University of KZN",
    "Fare": 7,
    "Trips": 18
  },
  {
    "RegistrationNumber": "ND 123 456",
    "Route": "Durban - Umbilo",
    "Fare": 8,
    "Trips": 15
  },
  {
    "RegistrationNumber": "ND 234 567",
    "Route": "Durban - Umbilo",
    "Fare": 8,
    "Trips": 9
  },
  {
    "RegistrationNumber": "ND 345 678",
    "Route": "Durban - Umlazi Station",
    "Fare": 14,
    "Trips": 20
  }
];
```

Now let's do the same kind of calculations for the Durbs data.

* How many trips did all the taxis make?
* What's the lowest number of trips that any taxi in Durban made?
* What records do we have for ND 123 456?
* How many trips did ND 234 567 make?
* What are the names of all the routes that ND 345 678 took?
* What are the total earnings for ND 234 567?
* What are the total earnings for each taxi?
